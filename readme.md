# dotnet_forms

#summary
library of useful/common forms and handlers to more rapidly deploy
desktop applications with usable/user friendly-ish set of utilities.

I'll have two sets of sub-forms that will be targeting the GNOME desktop,
and windows forms.

files across project directories need to be within the same "dotnet_forms" namespace.
when compiling - different components may be used depending on the target platform.
